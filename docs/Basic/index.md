# **Basic Documentation**

* **What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?** Concurrency is about multiple tasks which start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, in no specific order. Parallelism is about multiple tasks or subtasks of the same task that literally run at the same time on a hardware with multiple computing resources like multi-core processor.
