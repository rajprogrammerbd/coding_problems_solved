# **MySQL Command Documentation Guide**

> In order to select a database, we can double click on it's name, or we can use the command **USE database_name** to select a database.

> If we want to select from a column, then we have to use this syntax **SELECT * or names_of_rows FROM columns_name**, for example **SELECT * from customers**.
